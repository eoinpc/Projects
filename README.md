Some of the projects and work I have done with data, including visualizations, dashboards, machine learning, and more, mostly in Python. A summary of each major file is below.

- “Taylor Swift Visualizations.ipynb” is one of the most interesting personal projects I did, as there is a lot of talk that Taylor Swift almost only sings about her exes, mentioning love and heartbreak ad nauseam, so I decided to look to the data to see if this is the case. In order to obtain the data, I utilized the Spotify API for track names and statistics, as well as the Genius API for song lyrics. In the end, I found that only 4 out of 10 of her albums had a significant presence of the word ‘love’, but each album focuses on a different perspective of life, so there are most likely other words representing love and heartbreak that I did not account for. Overall, I really enjoyed this project as I love listening to Taylor Swift’s music, as well as getting to explore scraping data from APIs and answering questions with data.

- “Song Sentiment Analysis.ipynb” is a project in a similar vein, as it also focuses on music, something I love. In this project, I wanted to predict the sentiment of a song (happy, sad, angry, relaxed) based on the song’s lyrics. I could have gone an easier route for this, but I wanted to explore and learn about neural networks for use in prediction. This was a very tough subject, as some of the processes involved in neural networks are still hazy to me, but I did manage to create a working one in the end. Although getting 40% accuracy, I was still proud of the work I did, and I hope to return to this project another time when I am more experienced. More of the technical details are discussed in the Report PDF.

- “Dashboard_TEST.py” is part of my Senior Design project, in which I worked with a company to create a production tracking system which included an interactive dashboard with real-time data. The intent of this project was to reduce manual data entry by 50% and to increase efficiency of the production line by providing critical information on the status of boats to other departments. The dashboard was built using the Streamlit package in Python, allowing for creation of a simple and modular web-based dashboard. The image “Dashboard.png” shows some of the main page of the dashboard, including the visualization showing the number of products at each production stage as well as a table with all products in assembly with filter controls. While this project was not completely finished as my team and I only had 3 months and there were features not able to be implemented, I am still proud of the final product and I discovered an interest in dashboarding data.

- [In Progress] "Group Chat Dashboard.py" follows suit from the dashboard I built for my Senior Design project, as I realized how much I enjoy visualizing data and the format of a dashboard. This dashboard focuses on data from a group chat I have with my friends over 3 years, as I wanted to see how our vocabulary and activity has changed over this time using visualizations and statistics. In addition, I wanted to learn Dash, which is another Python framework for creating interactive dashboards. This project consists of the Group Chat Dashboard.py file, as well as the three page files for the dashboard (home.py, page2.py, page3.py).

- [In Progress] "spotify_analysis.pbix" is an exploration of my Spotify listening history, as I love listening to music and obsess over statistics and data pertaining to my listening. Since I have always used Python for data exploration, as shown with the previous projects, I wanted to try something different and get some exposure to Power BI. In this project, I am looking to generate a comprehensive report with data visuals to answer some burning questions I have about the music I listen to, such as which songs I skip the most or how my music taste has changed over 2 years, since I seem to find a new obsession every two weeks.
